Time Series Forecasting

ABC is the largest Bank in Uzbekistan and it has assigned to you the job of predicting how much operational loss they can expect to make in each quarter of 2018.

ABC bank allocates operational losses to three business divisions-A,B,C and to five event types: accounting and systematic errors, unpredictable natural disasters, legal events, fraud and others. For each of these event types, data has been collected for the past 22 years on a quarterly basis. The Bank’s directors want to know how much operational loss they can expect to make in 2018 on the basis of the past figures.

The given dataset has the following columns:

YR - Year
QR - Quarter of the year
BL - The Business division making the loss
AS- The losses made due to accounting and systematic errors
DW- The losses made due to unpredictable natural disasters
LL- The losses made due to legal events
ZY- The losses made due to fraud
QJ- The losses made due to other causes
C1- The total number of cases of accounting and systematic errors.
C2- The total number of cases of unpredictable natural disasters.
C3-The total number of cases of legal events
C4- The total number of cases of fraud
C5-The total number of other cases
Losses in a particular category are the aggregation of various small losses incurred throughout the year where the magnitude of loss amount and the number of such losses is random.

Make an appropriate model to accommodate these losses and give a 99% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL for each Division’s (mean) quarterly loss under each event type, ie, for each quarter in 2018, provide a 99% Confidence interval for the losses incurred by division A,B and C for each of the event type described in headings 4-8.
